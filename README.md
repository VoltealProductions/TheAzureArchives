# The Azure Archives
The Azure Archives is a web application written in Go that serves an API consumed by the Athenaeum Client website. It hosts character, guild, community, etc roleplaying profiles for the World of Warcraft US servers.

# Who Will This Application Serve?
Everyone! At least everyone who roleplays on World of Warcraft's US servers. While this is a project that started on Moon Guard (US) with cross-faction and cross-server guilds becoming a thing we are are going to mostly be ignoring servers. We see no reason to exclude Wyrmrest Accord (US), Emerald Dream (US), etc players from being able to use out app. The only place in the application where you will likely see realms referenced will be on guild pages, recruitment pages, and event pages. For guilds, particullarly for people who only want to recruit on their realm, there will be that option.
